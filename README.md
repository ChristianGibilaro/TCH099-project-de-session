## üöÄ Introduction

**LunarCovenant** is an innovative project aimed at bridging the gap between users seeking teammates for both virtual and real-world activities. It encompasses a **web platform** and an **Android application**, offering a seamless solution for short-term and long-term collaborations. Inspired by the community-driven model of platforms like Reddit, users will generate and moderate content on the platform, ensuring an engaging, user-centric experience.

The platform is designed to accommodate any activity that fosters interaction, from casual gaming to sports or professional team-building. While the website will provide comprehensive features, the Android app will focus on delivering the most essential functionalities.
